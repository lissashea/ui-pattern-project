**Photo Slider**
This is a simple image slider that allows users to view a series of images by clicking on 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. The slider is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Usage**
To use the photo slider, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a series of images with 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons below them. Clicking on the 'Next' button will shift the slider to show the next image, while clicking on the 'Previous' button will show the previous image. The slider will loop back to the other end of the list when it reaches the end.

Customization
You can customize the slider by editing the following files:

**index.html:** Change the list of images and their alt text. You can also change the text of the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons.
style.css: Change the styling of the slider container, images, and buttons. You can adjust the dimensions of the slider container, the position of the buttons, and the opacity transition of the images.

**main.js:** Change the behavior of the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. You can adjust the code to loop the slider back to the other end of the list when it reaches the end, or to disable the buttons when there are no more images to show.
